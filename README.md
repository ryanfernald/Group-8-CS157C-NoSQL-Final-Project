# About the Project

Carrier Messenger is a lightweight real-time messaging application designed to explore the integration of modern web technologies with both in-memory and persistent data storage systems. The frontend is built using React, providing a responsive and modular user interface. A Flask-based middle layer serves as the API gateway, handling client-server communication and coordinating data flows between the application and its databases. Message data is initially handled through Redis, a NoSQL in-memory data store, allowing for low-latency communication and temporary session management. After a defined lifecycle, messages and user data are asynchronously flushed to MySQL, which functions as the system’s long-term, relational data store. This architecture demonstrates the separation of volatile and persistent storage responsibilities, and highlights Redis’s value as a performance-oriented caching layer in hybrid database environments.

# The React App

The frontend of the Carrier Messenger project is built using React, allowing for modular component design and dynamic client-side rendering. It consists of two primary views: a login/signup landing page and a post-authentication messaging dashboard.

## Login / Signup Page

The landing page presents users with the option to either sign in or create a new account. Upon submitting the signup form, user credentials are temporarily stored in Redis for fast access and validation, and later persisted to MySQL. Successful login triggers the creation of a session token stored in Redis, allowing authenticated access to the messaging dashboard.

## Sending Messages 

After authentication, users are directed to the messages page, where they can view existing conversations, start new one-on-one or group chats, and send real-time messages. The interface dynamically loads associated chats and messages from Redis, allowing for fast interactions. User settings, such as profile photo and username, can also be managed directly from this interface.

## Starting a New Chat or a Group Chat

Users can initiate a new chat by entering the username or email of another user. The application checks Redis to verify that the recipient exists and that a direct one-on-one chat does not already exist. If validation passes, a new message_token is created and stored in Redis as a hash, which includes the chat_id, a list of participant user IDs, and a timestamp indicating when the chat was created. Group chats are initiated by adding multiple users to the chat creation form. The resulting message_token reflects all participant IDs and follows a naming pattern such as chat_user1_user2_user3_####, allowing for dynamic group composition.

All chats in Redis are stored temporarily using **expiring tokens**. When a token expires—either through logout or a timed expiration—the associated chat is automatically **flushed** to MySQL via a background monitoring service. This ensures that long-term storage is preserved without requiring constant writes to disk. Conversely, when a user logs back in, their associated chats are **hydrated** from MySQL into Redis for immediate access, allowing the application to balance low-latency performance with durable storage. This mechanism showcases how Redis can serve as a transient but performant caching layer in tandem with a persistent relational backend.

## Updating the User Profile

Users can update their profile information, including their username, password, and profile photo, from within the messaging interface. When a user edits their username, the system automatically detects changes and updates the value in both Redis and MySQL without modifying the user’s unique ID. This design ensures that existing chats and participant references remain valid, preserving the integrity of all message and chat associations. For password updates, the new password is hashed using SHA-256 encryption before being stored, ensuring that sensitive credentials are never saved in plain text. These updates take effect immediately, with Redis serving as a low-latency reflection of the user’s current state.
